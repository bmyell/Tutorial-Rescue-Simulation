### You can develop your own agents codes using only the files in the directories:
- src/adf/sample/centralized: source codes for central agents. This is the type of agents whose only interac-
tion with the world is through radio communication. There are three types of central agents: Ambulance
Centers, Fire Stations and Police Office, and they are represented as buildeings in the simulation server.
- src/adf/sample/extaction: codes of combining actions described in the directory below.
- src/adf/sample/module: concrete codes of algorithms, e.g. path planning, clustering, target detection,
etc. The directory contains two directories:
- src/adf/sample/module/algorithm
- src/adf/sample/module/complex

You must not make any changes of files in “src/adf/sample/tactics”. This is the restriction for
our current competition rule.

You should fundamentally copy the sample codes, not edit them. The reason is that the sample codes would
be used if ADF could not find your own codes. You can easily change reference to your modules by modifying
“src/adf/config/module.cfg”. The usage of the file is described below.


##### 你可以开发自己的球队通过以下目录里的文件
- src/adf/sample/centralized: agents的核心代码．这里是那种通过广播交流的agent.共有三种agent，救护中心、消防站和警察局，他们表示在模拟服务器房屋建筑部分。

- src/adf/sample/extaction: 下面目录中描述的联合操作代码。

- src/adf/sample/module: 具体的算法代码，如路径规划，聚类，目标检测，等等. The directory contains two directories:

- src/adf/sample/module/algorithm
- src/adf/sample/module/complex
