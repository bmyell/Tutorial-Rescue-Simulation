The modules configuration file “src/adf/config/module.cfg” indicates which codes would be used as agents’
module. Fig. 6 shows part of the modules configuration file. The left-hand side of the colon indicates the mod-
ule name, the right-hand side is the class name. In most cases, modules of which targets’ problems are the same
should refer to an identical class for all agent types. The example in Fig. 6 is in “TacticsAmbulanceTeam.Search”
and “TacticsFireBrigade.Search” indicates that both modules refer to “adf.sample.module.complex.SampleSearch”.
An usage example is shown in Section 5.5.3.
